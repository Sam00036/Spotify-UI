# Spotify-UI
Another Milestone of this Year!!!
As a new bie in web development I build a spotify UI using simple HTML and CSS. 
Here I try to implement some more basic tools like live lyrics sytem and auto adjustable to improve user interface of the application. 
I will also try to implement some more basic java script features in future to make the user interface more better.
